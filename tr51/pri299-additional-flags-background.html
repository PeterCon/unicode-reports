	<h2>PRI #299 Background: Representing Additional Types of Flags</h2>
	<h4>Last updated: 2015-06-29</h4>

	<h2>A. Background</h2>

	<p>The Unicode Standard already provides a mechanism to represent flags
		using pairs of REGIONAL INDICATOR symbols U+1F1E6..U+1F1FF, which
		were added in Unicode 6.0. The mechanism is documented in the current
		text of the standard and covered in
		<a target='_blank' href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Flags">Annex B</a>
		of UTR #51.</p>

	<p>On several systems, pairs of REGIONAL INDICATOR symbols are used to
		represent up to more than 200 flags as emoji. These pairs correspond to
		<a target='_blank' href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_region_subtag">unicode_region_subtag</a>
		two-letter codes, which can represent some regions such as Isle of Man,
		Guernsey, and Puerto Rico but not others, such as England, Scotland, Wales,
		U.S. states, or Russian Federation republics.</p>

	<p>The unicode_region_subtags defined in CLDR are based on
		<a target='_blank' href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP47</a>,
		which is in turn based on ISO 3166-1 and
		<a target='_blank' href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm">UN M49</a>
		codes.</p>

	<p>On some platforms that support a number of emoji flags, there is
		substantial demand to support additional flags beyond those defined for
		unicode_region_subtags, such as for the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>“Country subdivisions” such as England, Scotland, Wales, U.S. states, and Russian Federation republics.</li>
		<li>Certain supra-national organizations such the United Nations.</li>
		<li>Certain 3 digit regional codes, used in BCP47 to stabilize ISO 3166-1 codes.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>B. Proposal</h2>

	<p>This proposal describes a mechanism for representing
		<a target='_blank' href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_region_subtag">unicode_region_subtag</a>s
		and
		<a href="#unicode_subdivision_subtag">unicode_subdivision_subtag</a>s
		with TAG characters for designating flags. The proposal will extend
		<a target='_blank' href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/">UTR #51</a>
		and includes several parts:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Use the TAG characters E0030..E0039 (TAG DIGITs) and E0041..E005A
			(TAG LATIN CAPITAL LETTERs). These TAG characters are default-ignorable,
			without any visible representation by themselves.</li>

		<li style="margin-top:10px;">Designate the character U+1F3F3 WAVING WHITE
			FLAG as the “base” for a subsequent sequence of TAG characters. This
			character already encoded, with general category value So.
			<ul>
				<li>This base character is a visible spacing character that
					suggests a flag, so that implementations that do not support
					the TAG characters have an indication that a flag is present.</li>
			</ul></li>

		<li style="margin-top:10px;">Define valid sequences as the base character
			followed by a sequence of TAG characters, as specified by either of the
			following conditions:
			<ul>
				<li>A sequence of three TAG DIGIT characters designating a
					unicode_region_subtag.
					<ul>
						<li>This is needed primarily to handle cases in which
							ISO 3166-1 reassigns 2-letter codes that are already in
							the BCP 47 registry. It may also be used to designate
							flags for certain supra-national organizations. See
							the discussion below.</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li>A sequence of TAG characters that correspond to a valid
					unicode_region_subtag followed by a unicode_subdivision_subtag,
					where the latter is valid for that region.
					<ul>
						<li>The hyphen used in ISO 3166-2 syntax is not necessary
							to separate the two parts.</li>
					</ul></li>
			</ul></li>

		<li style="margin-top:10px;">Provide guidelines and constraints for the
			use of the TAG sequences, to help ensure stable and non-redundant
			representation of regions and regional subdivisions:
			<ul>
				<li>UTR #51 already specifies that only those codes valid for the
					LDML unicode_region_subtag are used with regional indicators.
					<ul>
						<li>This prevents multiple representation of many regions
							which have both an ISO 3166-1 code and a UN M49 code,
							and provides management of code deprecation, etc.).</li>
						<li>Note that this <em>allows</em> the “exceptionally reserved”
							code EU (European Union), but does <em>not</em> allow the
							“exceptionally reserved” code UN (United Nations).</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li>In CLDR 28 (September, 2015), LDML will define a
					unicode_subdivision_subtag, which also provides validity criteria
					for the codes used for regional subdivisions. These subdivision
					codes are based on
					<a target='_blank' href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=63546">ISO 3166-2</a>,
					but also provide stability. Only valid LDML
					unicode_subdivision_subtags can be used to represent regional 
					subdivision flags.
					<ul>
						<li>For example, ISO 3166-2 defines “GB-SCT” for Scotland,
							“GB-WLS” for Wales, “US-DE” for Delaware, and “NO-18”
							for Nordland (in Norway).</li>
						<li>Note that a particular unicode_subdivision_subtag may
							be deprecated, but will not be removed, and thus
							forever remains valid (though discouraged).</li>
					</ul></li>
			</ul></li>
	</ol>

	<h2>C. Syntax</h2>

	<p>The syntax for well-formed subdivision flags is:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><code>B((TL{2} (TL|TD){1,4})  | (TD{3} (TL|TD){1,4}?))</code></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This uses the following notation:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<table>
			<tr><td width="8%"><code>B</code></td><td>designates the chosen base character (U+1F3F3)</td></tr>
			<tr><td width="8%"><code>TL</code></td><td>designates a TAG LATIN CAPITAL LETTER (A..Z)</td></tr>
			<tr><td width="8%"><code>TD</code></td><td>designates a TAG DIGIT (ZERO..NINE)</td></tr>
		</table>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Not all syntactically well-formed TAG sequences correspond to an actual
		flag—only a defined subset can be used. </p>

	<h2>D. Text break considerations</h2>

	<p>The TAG characters have general category value Cf and line break property
		value CM. Consequently, the proposed base character followed by a sequence
		of TAG characters is already treated as a unit for word, sentence, and
		line break. Grapheme break property values and rules would need some
		adjustment; until those are updated in
		<a target='_blank' href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/">UAX #29</a>,
		implementations could use a tailored grapheme break to handle these
		correctly.</p>

	<p>The proposal will add language to UTR #51 recommending that each
		REGIONAL INDICATOR pair used to designate a flag be followed by
		U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (ZWNJ) to facilitate text break.
		ZWNJ is in the Extend class for grapheme and word break, and will
		thus be included in a grapheme or word with the preceding
		REGIONAL INDICATORs.</p>

	<h2>E. Discussion</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Note that TAG sequences <em>could</em> also be used to designate
			flags corresponding to two-letter
			<a target='_blank' href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_region_subtag">unicode_region_subtag</a>s,
			using the base character followed by two TAG LATIN CAPITAL LETTERs.
			This alternative to the use of paired REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL
			letters to designate unicode_region_subtags has better inherent
			behavior for text break. However, doing so would result in two
			possible representations for many flags, so is not recommended.
			Note that the TAG sequences do allow for 3-digit region codes for
			the case where ISO destabilizes codes, by allowing the use of
			the three digit forms from BCP47.</li>

		<li style="margin-top:10px;">Instead of using U+1F3F3 WAVING WHITE FLAG
			as the base for a TAG sequence, an alternative possibility is
			encoding a new character, perhaps U+1F1E5 REGIONAL FLAG BASE.
			Encoding a new character would delay support for the desired flags
			until it could be encoded (and the character alone would still need
			some sort of representation as a flag), so is not recommended.</li>

		<li style="margin-top:10px;">A special fallback appearance should be
			used for the base followed by any unsupported or invalid sequence
			of TAG characters. The recommended glyph for the fallback is
			U+1F3F3 WAVING WHITE FLAG in a dotted rectangle.</li>

		<li style="margin-top:10px;">Use of UN M49 codes to designate flags
			for supra-national and international organizations requires
			additional guidelines. For many M49 codes that designate
			supra-national regions, there is no reasonable flag; for others
			there are several possibilities, but all may have some political
			issues. For example:
			<ul>
				<li>Representing the UN flag: One possibility is to use
					region 001 (World). However, region 001 could be
					associated with many other organizations as well;
					and some people may have political objections to
					using the UN flag to represent the world.</li>
			</ul></li>

		<li style="margin-top:10px;">It is not anticipated—by any means—that
			flags for all or even most subdivision codes would be supported.
			Many subdivisions don’t have flags, or don’t have widely
			recognized flags. We would expect that certainly initially,
			and perhaps long term, only a relatively small number of
			subdivision flags would be widely supported and deployed.</li>
	</ol>

	<h4><a href="#Unicode_Subdivision_Codes"
		name="Unicode_Subdivision_Codes">3.6.5 Subdivision Codes</a></h4>

	<p>The subdivision codes are based on ISO 3166-2 codes, which
		have 1..3 ASCII letters or digits. Like BCP47, CLDR needs stable codes, which
		are not guaranteed for ISO 3166-2 (nor have they been stable in the past).</p>

	<p>CLDR thus adds 4-character sequences, also ASCII letters or
		digits, which can be used for stability. If an ISO 3166-2 code is removed,
		it remains valid (though marked as deprecated) in CLDR. If an ICU 3166-2 code
		is reused for a different subdivision (within the same region), then CLDR
		will define a new equivalent code using these 4-character sequences.</p>

	<p>...</p>

	<p>A unicode_subdivision_subtag is valid for a
	  	<a target='_blank' href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_region_subtag">unicode_region_subtag</a>
	  	only when the <strong>subdivisionContainment</strong> element contains a
	  	<strong>subgroup</strong> element where:</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>the <strong>type</strong> attribute value is that
	    	<a target='_blank' href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_region_subtag">unicode_region_subtag</a>,
	    	and</li>
	    <li>the <strong>contains</strong> attribute value  contains the
	    	unicode_subdivision_subtag.
	    	<ul>
	        	<li>The <strong>contains</strong> attribute value is a space-delimited
	        		set, and compared case-insensitively.</li>
         	</ul></li>
	</ol>

	<p>For example, the subdivision “ca” (and “CA”) is valid for the
		region “US” because of the following element:</p>

	<p align="center"> <code>&lt;subgroup type=&quot;US&quot;
		contains=&quot;… CA …&quot;/&gt;</code></p>

	<p>...</p>
