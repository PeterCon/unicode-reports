		</h2>
		<p>There are many requests for variants of Unicode emoji. This
			document provides a concrete proposal for a mechanism that could be
			used for such customization, using the Unicode TAG characters. This
			approach allows the creation of variant emoji images without waiting
			for them to be encoded, and has been designed to be extensible.</p>
		<p>The basic idea is like that of skin tone modifiers, used when a
			user selects an olive-skinned emoji on the keyboard. Internally that
			emoji consists of a base emoji followed by a skin-tone modifier that
			indicates that the base emoji should be olive-skinned. The
			olive-skinned emoji looks like a single character to the user, and
			behaves as a single emoji character in display, line break, and other
			processing.</p>
		<p>With this TAG mechanism, a given emoji can have a specified
			list of special “TAG” characters after it that indicate a particular
			customization: the whole sequence is called an “emoji tag sequence”.
			The emoji tag sequence looks like a single character to the user, and
			behaves as a single emoji character in display, line break, and other
			processing. The TAG mechanism differs from the skin-tone modifiers in
			being much extensible.</p>
		<p>
			The gray image in the illustrations below represent a sequence of TAG
			characters; the exact sequence that would be used in each case is
			described in the <a href='#Technical_Specification'>Technical Specification</a>. For
			example, the image on the left below would be what the user sees; the
			sequence on the right would be the internal representation. The TAG
			characters indicated by the gray “…&#10022;” below would never be
			visible.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img alt="" src="images/scottish-flag.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><span style='font-size: 36px'>
				= </span><img alt="" src="images/white-flag.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><img alt=""
				src="images/tag-coda.png" title="tag sequence" height='36px'
				width='auto'>
		</p>
		<p>If the TAG sequence is invalid, or if the system doesn't
			support that tag sequence, the user would see an indication of that,
			such as:</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img alt="" src="images/image07.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><span style='font-size: 36px'>
				= </span><img alt="" src="images/white-flag.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><img alt=""
				src="images/tag-coda.png" title="tag sequence" height='36px'
				width='auto'>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Unicode emoji customization mechanism is used to request an
			alternate rendering of a particular emoji character. It is only used
			where the base emoji character is in some way generic, and the
			customization would be considered a variant of that base character.
			For example, it could be used to indicate that the MAN emoji should
			be shown with red hair, but <em>not</em> that the MAN emoji be shown
			as a cup of tea.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only those emoji tag sequences that follow the specifications in this
			document are valid. Like the emoji sequences for different family
			groups (aka <em>emoji zwj sequences</em>), Unicode would catalog
			those sequences that are supported by major vendors, but would not
			recommend particular combinations.
		</p>
		<p>The first specified customizations include flags, gender, hair
			color, and direction. The hair color, gender, direction, and
			emoji-modifiers could be applied to the same emoji, resulting in a
			combinatorial explosion of possible glyphs in fonts. The flag
			customizations also allow for a very large number of possible glyphs.
			Due to memory constraints, it is thus anticipated that only certain
			combinations would be supported by major vendors. There is no
			requirement or expectation that all of the possible combinations — or
			even any large subset of them — be supported by vendors, until there
			is technology in the fonts to deal with the combinatorics.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Flags. </strong>These customizations allow for additional
			emoji for images of a flag associated with particular regions, such
			as emoji depictions of the flag of Scotland or California.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img alt="" src="images/scottish-flag.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><span style='font-size: 36px'>
				= </span><img alt="" src="images/white-flag.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><img alt=""
				src="images/tag-coda.png" title="tag sequence" height='36px'
				width='auto'>
		</p>
		<p>They are limited to Unicode subdivisions (which generally
			correspond to ISO 3166-2 subdivisions), and valid 3-digit UN codes.
			Like the Regional_Indicator characters, they do not represent a
			specific image. One way to think of them is that they represent “a
			flag” for a region, not “the flag” for a region. This mechanism
			cannot be used for arbitrary flags. It cannot, for example, be used
			for a rainbow flag, the flag of a particular football club, or a
			pirate flag.</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Gender. </strong>These customizations allow for emoji images
			with different genders.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img alt="" src="images/woman-runner.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><span style='font-size: 36px'>
				= </span><img alt="" src="images/runner.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><img alt=""
				src="images/tag-coda.png" title="tag sequence" height='36px'
				width='auto'>
		</p>
		<p>Unicode itself does not normally specify the gender for emoji
			characters: the emoji character is RUNNER, not MAN RUNNING; POLICE
			OFFICER not POLICEMAN. For a greater sense of realism, however,
			vendors typically have picked a particular gender to display, even
			for the neutral characters.</p>
		<p>The Gender customization allow vendors to display male, female,
			and neutral versions. Neutral doesn’t mean the default (untagged)
			presentation, which could be any of these three; it means a
			specifically a gender-neutral presentation. These customizations are
			to mark appearance, and not gender identification.</p>
		<p>The following is a draft list of emoji characters that would
			allow customizations of gender. The comment (after #) includes the
			version of Unicode where the character was encoded, an image, and the
			character name.</p>
		<p class='reviewnote'>Review Note: the images are currently
			characters, so the appearance will depend on the platform people view
			them on. They will be supplemented by an image so that people can
			read this document without having emoji support.</p>

		<p>This includes characters that have explicit gender in their

		<p class="reviewnote">Review Note: Some characters encoded to form
			gender pairs might not have been encoded had this mechanism been

			remove these characters.</p>
		<p class="reviewnote">Review Note: Possible removals from the base
			character list above: For the 9.0 sports figures, we could drop those
			for which we have consensus to only show neutral images. We need to
			look at whether JUGGLING might be a person or should not be. Finally,
			we are considering removal of the three “IN SILHOUETTE” characters
			(two BUSTS, one SPEAKING HEAD).</p>

			<strong>Direction.</strong> These customizations allow for emoji
			images to have different directions.
		</p>
		<p align='center'>
			<img alt="" src="images/thumbs-up-left.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><span style='font-size: 36px'>

				width='auto'>
		</p>
		<p>Some characters are typically presented with a direction that
			may be semantically significant in sequences of emoji: such as
			pointing in the direction of an action. Unfortunately, for historical
			reasons the “default” direction is fairly arbitrary; you see some
			emoji pointing left &#x1f3a5; and others pointing right &#x1f4fd;.</p>
		<p>For example, controlling the direction allows for different
			compositions with hands around faces:</p>
		<p align='center'>
			<span style="font-size: 36px">…</span><img alt=""
				src="images/thumbs-up-left.png" title="tag sequence" height='36px'
				width='auto'><img alt="" src="images/apple_1f61c.png"
				title="tag sequence" height='36px' width='auto'><img alt=""
				src="images/thumbs-up-right.png" title="tag sequence" height='36px'
				width='auto'><span style="font-size: 36px">…</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			Or, when someone is trying to say “then the princess stabbed the
			prince” when commenting on the <em>Game of Thrones,</em> it would be
			far more natural to see (a) below rather than (b), which could be
			interpreted as “the prince stabbed the princess”:
		</p>
		<p align="center">

			sequences, which allow for experimentation and interchange in closed
			systems, but which are not suitable for general interchange. For more
			information, see the <a href='#Technical_Specification'>Technical Specification</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Unsupported. </strong>Where the emoji tag sequence is not
			supported by an implementation, the tag characters are invisible and
			occupy no space. If the implementation is aware of the tag mechanism,
			but the sequence is invalid or the implementation does not support a
			particular sequence, then the fallback character should be displayed
			with a question mark superimposed, such as the following:
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img alt="" src="images/image07.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><span style='font-size: 36px'>
				= </span><img alt="" src="images/white-flag.png" title="tag sequence"
				height='36px' width='auto'><img alt=""
				src="images/tag-coda.png" title="tag sequence" height='36px'
				width='auto'>
		</p>
		<p>That way, the recipient is notified that there is something odd
			about the character; that it isn’t exactly what the sender intended.
			The above appearance is not normative: the goal is have a
			superimposed question mark, but there could be alternate appearances
			so that the base character is less obscured. However, an
			implementation cannot show a variant that is not specified by
			Unicode, unless it uses a Private Use tag sequence.</p>
		<p class="reviewnote">Review Note: one by-product of the direction
			of this work is that the Emoji SC and UTC should focus primarily on
			“generic” emoji characters, rather than very specific versions.</p>
		<p class="reviewnote">Review Note: We considered various other
			models:</p>
		<ul class="reviewnote">
			<li>Additional modifier characters would be possible, but there
				is a long lead time for defining them, whereas additional keys or
				values could be added relatively quickly: months not years.</li>
			<li>Variation selectors could be used, except that the number is
				constrained and they are defined as limited to only one per base.
				This feature is built into too much software to change without
				severe compatibility problems.</li>

		<p>This section provides a technical description for how the valid
			tag sequences are specified.</p>

		<h3>
			3.1 <a href='#Overall_Syntax' name='Overall_Syntax'>Overall Syntax</a>
		</h3>
		<p>The customization syntax uses the 95 invisible TAG characters:
		</p>
		<p>U+E0020..U+E007F (TAG SPACE..CANCEL TAG).</p>
		<p>
			These correspond to ASCII characters, and may be referenced by an
			abbreviated name of the form Tag-&lt;single-ascii-character&gt;, such
			as Tag-U for U+E0056
			TAG LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V. In examples, where clear, they can also
			be represented simply by the corresponding underlined ASCII letters.
			The tag-term can be represented by &#10022;. The regex characters ?,
			*, + have their normal meaning.
		</p>
		<p>In addition, there are the following special terms:</p>
		<table class='simple'>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<th>Notation</th>
					<th>Characters</th>

					<td>U+E0020..U+E0040, U+E005B..U+E007E</td>
					<td>Tag characters that are neither tag-term nor tag-keyChar.</td>

		</table>
		<p class="reviewnote">Review Note: the original plan was to add to
			UTR #51 definitions ED-10a and ED-10b below, plus new terms for ED-13
			and ED-15. However, since this document is now more generally about
			emoji mechanisms, it may be best to move (or at least copy) other
			definitions here (and then add these).</p>
		<p>
			<strong>ED-10a. emoji tag sequence</strong>
		</p>
		<p>A sequence consisting of an emoji character followed by one or
			more non-terminating TAG characters, followed by a terminating TAG
			character.</p>

			<code>
				emoji-tag-sequence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tag-base-item

		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>ED-10b. A tag-base-variation-sequence is an emoji
				variation sequence that starts with a tag-base. </strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Add emoji-tag-sequence to the following definitions in
				UTR51: </em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>ED-13. emoji modifier sequence</strong>, and <strong>ED-15.
				emoji core sequence. </strong>
		</p>
		<h3>Further Constraints:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The entire sequence, including the tag-base and tag-term is
				limited to 16 characters.</li>
			<li>Within the tag sequence, the tag-key-value-pairs must be
				sorted in ascending code-point order of the tag-key.</li>
			<li>Within the tag sequence, no two tag-key-value-pairs can have
				the same tag-key.</li>
			<li>No key can start with <u>Z</u> except a private use key.
			</li>
			<li>If a private use key occurs, it must be the only key.</li>
			<li>Further structure of the tag-value is determined by the
				tag-key.</li>
			<li>The tag-value could have a single semantic or some more
				complicated structure. For example, the tag-key could require sorted
				order among characters of the tag-value</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Thus—in ASCII terms—each key is a tag sequence that consist of one or
			<u>A</u>..<u>Z</u> characters. So <u>A</u> is a key, as is <u>AB</u>
			or <u>ZZ</u>. The value is any sequence of one or more characters
			from <u>_</u> (Tag-space) to <u>~</u>, outside of <u>A</u>..<u>Z</u>.
			For example, a tag-key-value-pair could be <u>Fusca</u>, representing
			the key= <u>F</u> and value = <u>usca</u>. The interpretation of each
			tag-key-value-pair depends on the tag-base, tag-key, and tag-value.
		</p>
		<p>
			Example: &lt;tag-base&gt;<u>ABxAy</u>&#10022; is invalid, as is
			&lt;tag-base&gt;<u>AxAy</u>&#10022;.
		</p>
		<p class="reviewnote">Review Note: the length (currently 16) is up
			for discussion, but everyone is agreed that we need a fixed limit.</p>
		<p class="reviewnote">Review Note: the committee considered
			whether to have the tag-term or not. In theory, it is not necessary
			for termination, because the tag sequence is always bounded by any
			non-TAG characters.</p>
		<p class="reviewnote">For font lookup, however, people didn’t want
			to have to backup when a non-TAG character is seen. To mark the end,
			it would be sufficient to forbid sequences that are prefixes of other
			valid sequences. The easiest way to ensure that is to always have a
			terminator. In some cases, it may not be necessary, but it makes
			validity checking much easier.</p>
		<p>This defines the well-formed emoji tag sequences. However, the
			only currently valid sequences are those defined in the following
			sections. All others are reserved for future use. Only certain
			tag-keys are valid for a given tag-base, and only certain tag-values
			are valid for the given tag-key. The tag-value may also have internal
			syntax.</p>
		<p>An emoji modifier that affects the customized emoji should
			follow the complete sequence representing the customized emoji, and
			in a sequence such as &lt;Char ZWJ Char TAG+&gt; the TAG sequence
			applies only to the second character in the sequence.</p>
		<p class="reviewnote">Review Note: The tag sequences that are
			likely to have the highest priority in initial implementations are
			likely to be the subdivision flags and the gender tags. Should we
			remove the direction and hair color tag sequences from the first
			version?</p>

			</li>
			<li>They are only lowercase letters and number TAGs: [<u>0</u>-<u>9</u>

			3.3 <a href='#Attributes_General' name='Attributes_General'>Attributes General Info</a>

		<ul>
			<li>Hair color (eg, black, blond, brown, red, gray, bald)</li>
			<li>Gender (eg, make a runner be male vs female)</li>
			<li>Direction (for faces with direction, hand gestures,
				vehicles, pistol, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Further Constraints:</h4>
		<p>The Tag-Base and tag-key-value-pair values are listed below. A
			Tag-Base character can be in any of the listed classes. Each class
			has a set of valid attributes. Additional classes and attributes may
			be added in future versions.</p>
		<p>The choice of Tag-Value characters is somewhat arbitrary, since
			they are not visible to users. However, they are chosen to be
			mnemonic where possible, since that is useful for internal debugging
			(more recognizable than Tag-1, Tag-2, etc.).</p>
		<p>
			Additional emoji properties are added to [<a href="#emoji_data">emoji-data</a>] in support of these, with a new

			Private Use emoji customizations include:</p>
		<ul>

			<li>a customized emoji sequence has defined properties that
				depend on the base emoji character, while for private-use Unicode

				possibly requiring an override of standard Unicode properties —
				which may not be feasible).</li>

		</h2>
		<p>
			The hair color, gender, and emoji-modifiers could, in theory, be
			mixed, resulting in a combinatorial explosion of glyphs in fonts. It
			is anticipated that only certain combinations would be supported
			generally until the technology supports them without a massive size
			increase. There are a few possible avenues. One is the “<a
				href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mx_(title)&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1455031838116000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEe_TCP_XSbi-d-6tn0rQpW8fSoEg">Mr(s)</a><img src="http://unicode.org/img/external_link.png" alt="">
			Potato Head” approach, whereby glyph pieces are assembled for a
			particular image. For example, there might be some different color
			hair styles that would be appropriate for overlaying on a RUNNER
			emoji. These could then be used to create male and female variants.
		</p>
		<p>A more general approach is to allow override of the color
			palettes in the images in the font. With this approach, exactly the
			same image of a girl can be used with many combinations of hair and
			skin color, for example.</p>
		<p>If the rendering engine can mirror images in the font, then the
			direction can also be supported generally with little size overhead.
