UTR #53 notes.

This file contains items that are to be done later.
It was started after Revision 4 was published as the
first approved version.


---------------------------------------------

Email from Julie, October 3, 2018.

These notes for post Revision 4, to do at next update.

Ken, Rick,

Lorna provided an updated document. I see a few other places where
titlecasing is needed or where some rewording might help, but would like a
second glance from Ken. This is my list of suggestions. If it's too early to
worry about some of this, that's fine. Rick has the updated draft. We can
forward it to you, if you want to take a look. I'm assuming Rick could just
make these changes, so Lorna can be done for now.

Yet-to-be-encoded => Yet-to-be-Encoded (TOC and in text as header)

Section 5.13, Unknown and Missing Characters, Section 7.9, Combining Marks,
and Section 9.2, Arabic => italicize the "Section x.y," parts of all of
these

Same thing later for another use of Section 9.2, Arabic

For use by this algorithm, this specification defines a group of combining
marks called “Modifier Combining Marks” (MCM). => flip the sentence to read,
"This specification defines a group of combining marks called “Modifier
Combining Marks” (MCM) for use by this algorithm."

It puts a sukun over a seen above. If an orthography needs to put the seen
above over the sukun => I wonder if we should use "place" rather than "put"
(might be something to search for if we make the change)

Similarly, " the meem is normally kept after fatha" --maybe "kept after"
isn't the best word choice?

However, since the combining class for the sukun is 34 => change since to
because

Sukun alternate forms => titlecase alternate and forms

Em-dash -- close up spaces on each side (this may occur a couple times)

If the algorithm were to use NFC instead, the sequence <alef, superscript
alef, madda> would have resulted in a different order than => I think the
tense is off here. Maybe, "If the algorithm had used..."?

some lesser known orthography =>lesser-known

There is no intention or expectation that AMTRA would be applied to stored
text. =>AMTRA is not intended or expected to be applied to stored text.

As an example, =>For example,
